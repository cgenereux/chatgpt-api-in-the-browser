# ChatGPT API in the Browser

This project provides a simple web interface for talking to OpenAI's ChatGPT models using your own API key. The page stores your key and conversation history in your browser's local storage.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Enter your OpenAI API key and click **Save**.
3. Choose a model and start chatting.
4. Your conversation is stored locally and can be cleared or downloaded as JSON.

**Security note:** your API key is stored in plain text in your browser's storage. Do not use this on shared or untrusted computers.
