# ChatGPT API in the Browser

This project provides a simple web interface for talking to OpenAI's models using your own API key. The page stores your key and conversation history in your browser's `localStorage` so it persists between visits.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Enter your OpenAI API key and click **Save**.
3. Choose a model (`o3`, `o3-pro`, or `gpt-4.5-preview`) and start chatting.
4. Your conversation is stored locally (in your browser cache) and can be cleared or downloaded as JSON.
5. Download your conversation in .txt format with the download button.
