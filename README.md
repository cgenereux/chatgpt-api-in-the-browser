# ChatGPT API in the Browser (With o3-pro)

This project provides a simple web interface for talking to OpenAI's models using your own API key. The page stores your key and conversation history in your browser's `localStorage` so it persists between visits. Your conversation is stored locally (in your browser cache) and can be cleared or downloaded as JSON.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Enter your OpenAI API key.
3. Choose `o3`, `o3-pro`, or `gpt-4.5-preview`.
4. Resize the textbox to your liking
5. Download your conversations with the download button.
